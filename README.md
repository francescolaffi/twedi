TWEDI
=====
This project was done for a university course in 2010, by me and other students of TWEDI (tecnologie web e di internet), the theoretical part of the course was extremely basic, but I had to spend several hours in the lab to work on the project anyway, so I decided at least to learn something new, and I wrote a basic php 5.3 MVC framework to build to project on.

I analyzed several famous frameworks (Symfony, Cake, Code Igniter, ...) selecting the framework structure and patterns that gave the best tradeoff between simplicity, flexibility, maintainability, ... and using them as inspiration to write this. It was very interesting to learn how different frameworks work and a good training to solve real world problems. 

I mainly contributed to the framework, my colleagues contributed to the app based on it, thats why the lib is commented in english and the app in italian. I don't expect it to be particularly useful to anyone now, I just didn't want to trash it and sometime I use it as reference for some solutions or to compare/understand how something work.

DO NOT USE ANY CODE, it was never intended for production, its not utterly insecure, but it was never studied to be totally secure.
